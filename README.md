# What I found interesting about this article
According to Charles, "the problem with object-oriented languages is theyâ€™ve got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle". This metaphor vivdly shows the problem with the reuse of a class in OOP programming. Method to avoid such kind of situation is to create hierarchies which are not too deep. However, this solution just limits the benefit of reuse by limiting such kind of mechanism. Besides, I strongly agree with the suggesiotn of using interface-based programming to work on things like Polymorphism. I think the analysis in this article can help people comprehend the disadvantages of OOP programming in spite of its popularity.
